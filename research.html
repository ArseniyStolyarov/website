      <h3>Echo Chambers in the Free Market for News: Evidence from Telegram</h3>
      <p><em>Job Market Paper</em></p>
      <p>
        This paper studies how ideological echo chambers can emerge on platforms without algorithmic curation.
        Using novel data on political content producers on Telegram, I show that channels form tightly connected communities 
        through selective forwarding and audience flows. Producers face a trade-off between sharing engaging content 
        and promoting competitors, leading to self-reinforcing within-group sharing. 
        A structural simulation replicates the observed clustering and shows that, when content quality matters alongside ideology, 
        moderate algorithmic recommendations can increase diversity.

      <h3>Spatial Spillovers and Strategic Learning in Offshore Oil Exploration</h3>
      <p>
        We estimate a spatial correlation model using the history of oil and gas production and development 
        in the Gulf of Mexico. Firms’ drilling and timing decisions strongly depend on neighboring activity, 
        consistent with information diffusion and local strategic interactions.

      <h3>Testing the Private-Values Assumption in Oregon Timber Auctions</h3>
      <p>
        We develop a small-sample parametric test that exploits exogenous variation in rival mills’ distances 
        to auctioned tracts. Applying it to Oregon Department of Forestry data, we reject the independent private-values assumption, 
        finding evidence of common-value components in bidders’ valuations.

      <!-- Tennis -->
      <h3>Are All Points Created Equal? Evidence from Professional Tennis</h3>
      <p>
        Points within a tennis service game are strategically heterogeneous: players adjust serve speed and accuracy 
        in response to incentives—serving more aggressively when the marginal effect on winning probability is highest, 
        and more conservatively when points are less pivotal.
